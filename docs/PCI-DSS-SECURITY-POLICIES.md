## Executive Summary

This document establishes the security policies and procedures for the Cyreal A2A platform to ensure compliance with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) version 4.0. These policies are mandatory for all personnel who interact with systems that process, store, or transmit cardholder data.

### Policy Statement

Cyreal is committed to protecting cardholder data through implementation of comprehensive security controls that meet or exceed PCI-DSS requirements. Any violation of these policies may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination.

## Scope and Applicability

### In Scope Systems
- Cyreal A2A servers processing payment data
- User authentication systems
- Audit logging infrastructure
- Network segments containing cardholder data
- All connected agent systems

### Applicable Personnel
- System administrators
- Developers
- Security personnel
- Third-party vendors with system access
- All users with access to cardholder data

## Security Policies

### 1. Network Security Policy (Requirements 1 & 2)

#### 1.1 Firewall Configuration Standards
- All systems MUST be protected by properly configured firewalls
- Default deny-all policy with explicit allow rules
- Quarterly firewall rule review required
- No direct connections between internet and CDE (Cardholder Data Environment)

```bash
# Example firewall rules
iptables -P INPUT DROP
iptables -P FORWARD DROP
iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT

# Allow only RFC-1918 sources for A2A
iptables -A INPUT -s 192.168.0.0/16 -p tcp --dport 3500 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -s 10.0.0.0/8 -p tcp --dport 3500 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -s 172.16.0.0/12 -p tcp --dport 3500 -j ACCEPT
```

#### 1.2 Network Segmentation
- Cardholder data MUST be isolated in secure network segments
- A2A servers restricted to RFC-1918 addresses only
- DMZ required for any publicly accessible components
- Network diagrams updated within 24 hours of changes

### 2. Data Protection Policy (Requirements 3 & 4)

#### 2.1 Data Storage Requirements
- Primary Account Numbers (PAN) MUST NOT be stored unless absolutely necessary
- If stored, PAN must be:
  - Encrypted using AES-256
  - Truncated to last 4 digits when displayed
  - Protected by access controls

#### 2.2 Encryption Standards
```javascript
// Required encryption configuration
const encryptionPolicy = {
  algorithm: 'aes-256-gcm',
  keyLength: 256,
  keyRotation: 90, // days
  keyStorage: 'HSM', // Hardware Security Module
  transportSecurity: 'TLS 1.3'
};
```

#### 2.3 Data Retention and Disposal
- Cardholder data retained only as long as necessary
- Secure deletion required:
  - Electronic media: DoD 5220.22-M (3-pass overwrite)
  - Physical media: Cross-cut shredding or incineration
- Quarterly data retention review

### 3. Access Control Policy (Requirements 7, 8, 9)

#### 3.1 User Access Management
- Unique user IDs required for all personnel
- Role-based access control (RBAC) implementation
- Principle of least privilege enforced
- Access reviews conducted quarterly

#### 3.2 Authentication Requirements
```typescript
interface AuthenticationPolicy {
  passwordMinLength: 7;
  passwordComplexity: {
    uppercase: true;
    lowercase: true;
    numbers: true;
    specialChars: true;
  };
  passwordExpiration: 90; // days
  passwordHistory: 4; // cannot reuse last 4
  mfaRequired: true;
  sessionTimeout: 15; // minutes
  maxLoginAttempts: 6;
  lockoutDuration: 30; // minutes
}
```

#### 3.3 Physical Security
- Server rooms require badge access + biometric
- Visitor logs maintained for 3 months minimum
- Media storage in locked cabinets
- Clean desk policy enforced

### 4. Monitoring and Logging Policy (Requirement 10)

#### 4.1 Audit Logging Requirements
All systems MUST log the following events:
- User authentication (success and failure)
- All administrative actions
- Access to cardholder data
- System configuration changes
- Security policy violations

#### 4.2 Log Management
```yaml
logManagement:
  retention:
    online: 90 days      # Immediately available
    archive: 1 year      # Total retention
  integrity:
    signing: HMAC-SHA256
    tamperDetection: enabled
    centralCollection: SIEM
  review:
    daily: true
    automated: true
```
