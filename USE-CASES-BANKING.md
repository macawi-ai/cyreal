# Cyreal Use Cases for Banks & Financial Services

## üè¶ Why Banks Need Device Management

Every bank branch has dozens of devices that could be security risks:
- ATM components
- Card readers and PIN pads
- Receipt printers
- Cash counting machines
- Security cameras
- Employee USB drives
- Service technician devices

**Without Cyreal:** You don't know what's connected, who connected it, or if it's stealing data.

**With Cyreal:** Complete visibility and control over every device in your bank.

## üíº Real-World Banking Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Rogue USB Device Detection
**The Threat:** Employee brings infected USB drive from home

**What Happens:**
1. Employee inserts USB drive at teller station
2. Cyreal instantly blocks the device
3. Security team gets alert: "Unauthorized USB at Branch-01-Teller-03"
4. Dashboard shows: Device details, who tried to use it, when
5. Security reviews and either approves or maintains block

**Value:** Prevented potential ransomware attack that could cost $500K+

### Scenario 2: ATM Maintenance Verification
**The Situation:** Service tech arrives to repair ATM

**What Happens:**
1. Tech connects diagnostic device to ATM
2. Cyreal checks if device is pre-authorized for maintenance window
3. Logs complete audit trail: Tech ID, device serial, time connected
4. Alerts if device stays connected too long
5. Generates compliance report showing authorized maintenance

**Value:** Ensures only authorized maintenance, prevents ATM skimmers

### Scenario 3: PCI-DSS Compliance Audit
**The Requirement:** Auditor needs device inventory and access logs

**What Happens:**
1. Compliance officer clicks "Generate PCI Report"
2. Cyreal produces complete device inventory
3. Shows all device connections for past year
4. Highlights any policy violations
5. Exports audit-ready PDF in 30 seconds

**Value:** Reduces audit prep from 2 weeks to 2 hours

### Scenario 4: Branch Printer Security
**The Risk:** Network printers can be attack vectors

**What Happens:**
1. Cyreal monitors all printer connections
2. Detects when printer firmware updates
3. Alerts if printer starts unusual network activity
4. Blocks if printer tries to access sensitive systems
5. Maintains log for compliance

**Value:** Prevents printer-based attacks, ensures secure printing

### Scenario 5: Card Skimmer Prevention
**The Threat:** Criminal installs skimmer on card reader

**What Happens:**
1. Cyreal baseline records legitimate card reader signature
2. Criminal replaces/modifies reader
3. Cyreal detects hardware change instantly
4. Sends urgent alert: "Card Reader 01 hardware modified!"
5. Branch manager disables reader immediately

**Value:** Prevents customer card theft, avoids liability
