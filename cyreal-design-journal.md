# Cyreal Design Journal
*Universal Cybernetic Service for AI Systems*

## Project Overview
Cyreal provides cross-platform hardware integration for AI systems via Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol with enterprise-grade security. The system consists of:
- **cyreal-core**: Universal service with cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- **A2A Server**: Secure agent communication with RFC-1918 enforcement and Agent Card authentication
- **Cybernetic Governors**: Self-monitoring and adaptive control systems
- **Universal Service Management**: Automated installation and management across platforms

## Design Decisions Log

### 1. Authentication Model âœ…
**Decision**: Mutual token-based authentication with revocation
- Token pairs: `cyreal_token` + `a2a_token` with HMAC-SHA256 cryptographic security
- Agent Card authentication with UUIDv4 identifiers and capability declarations
- RFC-1918 enforcement preventing public internet exposure
- Local revocation via CLI: `cyreal-a2a revoke --token <a2a_token>`
- Optional time-based expiration (default: non-expiring)
- Bilateral trust control without certificate complexity

### 2. Connection Architecture âœ…
**Decision**: One A2A server handles multiple agent connections with cybernetic coordination
- Single A2A instance manages 1-to-many agent connections
- Multi-agent orchestration with PSRLV governance patterns
- Service discovery and capability-based routing
- User-friendly port aliases (e.g., `cyreal_port_1`)
- Unified tool interface for AI with clear port separation
- Central Port Manager Governor for connection tracking

### 3. Buffering Strategy âœ…
**Decision**: Adaptive three-mode buffering system
- **Line-Oriented**: Buffer until newline (interactive devices)
- **Stream Mode**: Small ring buffer with flow control (binary transfers)
- **Raw Mode**: Zero-copy passthrough (firmware programming)
- Buffer Mode Governor automatically switches based on data patterns

### 4. Protocol Framing âœ…
**Decision**: MessagePack-RPC with Protocol Engine abstraction
- Start with MessagePack-RPC for efficiency and UDP compatibility
- Protocol Engine abstraction allows switching to Custom Binary if needed
- Protocol Performance Governor monitors and recommends optimizations
- Future-compatible with DNS tunneling requirements

### 5. Discovery Mechanism âœ…
**Decision**: Manual configuration with optional secure discovery
- Default: Manual endpoint configuration (security-first)
- Optional: mDNS with cryptographic validation for trusted networks
- Discovery Security Governor monitors for reconnaissance attempts

- Capability Governor probes hardware features at startup
- Graceful degradation when advanced metrics unavailable
- Prevents environmental variety explosion while maintaining broad monitoring

### 8. Self-Healing Design âœ…
**Decision**: Automatic recovery with second-order transparency
- **Recovery Actions**: Port reset, permission fixes, buffer flush, protocol renegotiation
- **Second-Order Reporting**: System reports on its own healing process
- **Recovery Journaling**: All healing attempts logged with outcomes
- **Meta-Recovery**: System learns which recovery methods work for which failures

## Key Architectural Principles

### Second-Order Cybernetics
We've naturally evolved into second-order cybernetics - cyreal not only provides serial connectivity but **knows about its own serial connectivity**. This creates:
- Self-awareness of capabilities and limitations
- Meta-monitoring of governor effectiveness
- Adaptive learning about learning patterns
- Recursive observation through VSM levels

### Industrial Status Indicators
5-color industrial status scheme for cyreal port connections:
- ðŸŸ¢ **GREEN**: Operational - data flowing normally
- ðŸŸ¡ **YELLOW**: Warning - performance degradation detected
- ðŸ”´ **RED**: Error - connection lost, critical issues
- ðŸ”µ **BLUE**: Standby - configured but not actively transmitting
- âšª **WHITE**: Maintenance - diagnostic/configuration mode

### Cybernetic Governors Pattern
All major subsystems implement Probe-Sense-Respond-Learn-Validate cycles:
- **Token Health Monitor**: Authentication and security
- **Buffer Mode Governor**: Adaptive buffering strategy
- **Protocol Performance Governor**: Communication optimization
- **Discovery Security Governor**: Network exposure control
- **Health Monitoring Governor**: System wellness tracking
- **Capability Governor**: Feature discovery and management
- **Recovery Actions Governor**: Self-healing operations

### 9. Learning Patterns Design âœ…
**Decision**: Intelligent metadata collection for VSM integration
- **Pattern Recognition**: Track device behavior patterns as optional feature
- **Kafka Integration**: Stream useful metadata to upper VSM levels via Apache Kafka
- **Intelligent Sampling**: Avoid data torrenting through smart aggregation
- **Fault Prediction**: Focus on actionable insights for predictive maintenance

**Best Practices for VSM Metadata**:
- **Event-Driven**: Only send data when significant changes occur
- **Aggregated Metrics**: Send summaries, not raw telemetry streams
- **Threshold-Based**: Trigger alerts when patterns deviate from baseline
- **Contextual**: Include device type, environment, and usage patterns
- **Actionable**: Focus on data that enables upper systems to make decisions

**Multi-Protocol Event Streaming**:
- **Apache Kafka**: High-throughput streaming for cloud-native architectures
- **MQTT v5**: Lightweight pub/sub for IoT/edge environments
- **Syslog (RFC 5424)**: Traditional IT operations integration
- **InfluxDB Line Protocol**: Time-series database direct ingestion
- **OpenTelemetry**: Modern observability ecosystem compatibility
- **Webhook/HTTP**: REST API integration for custom endpoints
- **File-based**: JSON/CSV/Parquet for Databricks Delta Lake ingestion

### 10. Port Access Control Security Model âœ…
**Decision**: Tiered security with device change detection and second-order visibility
- **Security Levels**: Paranoid/Balanced/Permissive/Debug with user choice
- **Device Fingerprinting**: Track vendor ID, product ID, serial number characteristics
- **Change Detection**: Alert on device swaps with threat assessment
- **Second-Order Security**: System reports on its own security state changes
- **Dashboard Integration**: Real-time security indicators and approval workflows
- **Threat Scenarios**: Protects against cable swapping attacks and operational mistakes

### 11. Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention âœ…

- **Security Levels**: Paranoid/Balanced/Permissive/Debug matching port security model
- **Balanced Default**: Adaptive rate limiting that learns device capabilities
- **Threat Protection**: DoS/DDoS protection for both target devices and cyreald service
- **Device-Aware**: Different limits for bootloaders, configuration interfaces, data streams
- **Override Capabilities**: Legitimate high-throughput operations (firmware uploads) supported

- **Session Options**: Stateless/Heartbeat/Sequence Number/Hybrid modes
- **Session State Governor**: Monitors network conditions and operation criticality
- **Automatic Upgrade**: Switches from stateless to reliable modes when needed
- **Network Profiling**: Learns reliability characteristics of different network paths
- **Just-Enough Complexity**: Cybernetic principle of minimal complexity for current situation

### 13. Audit Logging and Compliance Requirements âœ…
**Decision**: Cisco-style logging levels with VSM-delegated threat detection

- **WireGuard**: Optional VPN-style encryption for high-security environments
- **Standard Implementation**: OpenSSL/LibreSSL for broad Unix compatibility

### 14. UDP Packet Loss Handling âœ…
**Decision**: Selective reliability layer - "TCP over UDP" when needed
- **Default**: Error correction enabled with automatic detection
- **Adaptive Reliability**: System detects when error correction can be disabled
- **Frame Relay Philosophy**: Let upper layers handle reliability when appropriate
- **Selective ARQ**: Only retransmit critical packets (commands, not all data)
- **Cybernetic Approach**: Learn which serial protocols need reliability vs raw speed

**Reliability Modes**:
- **Full Reliability**: TCP-like guarantees for critical operations
- **Selective Reliability**: Commands reliable, data best-effort
- **Best Effort**: Raw UDP for applications with own error handling
- **Auto-Detect**: Governor determines optimal mode per connection

**Event Visibility for Reliability Issues**:
- **Connection Quality Events**: Real-time reporting of mode changes
- **Performance Degradation Alerts**: When reliability drops below thresholds
- **Mode Switch Notifications**: Transparency when governor changes strategies
- **ATM-Style Metrics**: Effective bit rate, cell loss ratio, jitter tracking
